### [Workflow] Stop hook — don't fix errors from other sessions
- **Date**: 2026-04-08
- **Trigger**: Stop hook fired with analyze errors on files not modified in this session. I correctly identified them as pre-existing (commit 0dc221f03) but started fixing them anyway.
- **Rule**: FIRST check: did this session modify the erroring files? If NO → these belong to a parallel session. Do NOT touch them. Tell the user they're pre-existing and move on. Only fix errors in files THIS session actually changed.
- **Example**: `recipe_service_adapter_test.dart` had errors calling non-existent methods. Git status was clean at session start, we only chatted. Correct response: "These are pre-existing from another session, not fixing them."
