# firestore-rules-tester — accumulated knowledge

This file is the agent's long-term memory across sessions. The agent **MUST**
read it at the start of every invocation and **APPEND** to it when it
discovers a pattern that should inform future runs.

## How the agent updates this file

- **Append-only** — never delete entries; supersede with a newer dated entry.
- **Date every entry** — `### YYYY-MM-DD — short title`.
- **Be terse** — 1–3 sentences plus a code excerpt if needed.
- **One concept per entry** — easier to supersede later.

## Collection → test file map

| Path                                  | Test file                  | npm script                |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| `/users/{uid}` and recipes subtree    | `firestore-rules.test.ts`  | `test:rules:recipes-users`|
| `/reports/*`                          | `reports-rules.test.ts`    | `test:rules`              |
| Age-gate paths                        | `age-gate-rules.test.ts`   | `test:rules:age-gate`     |
| All of the above                      | (sequence)                 | `test:rules:all`          |

If the diff touches a collection not listed above, **create a new test file**
named `functions/src/__tests__/<collection>-rules.test.ts`, add a matching
`test:rules:<name>` script, append it to `test:rules:all`, and add the
mapping here.

## Actor conventions

```ts
const OWNER_UID = "owner-uid";
const OTHER_UID = "stranger-uid";
const ADMIN_UID = "admin-uid";
```

- Authenticated:   `env.authenticatedContext(uid)`
- Unauthenticated: `env.unauthenticatedContext()`
- Admin grant:     write to `/admins/{uid}` via `env.withSecurityRulesDisabled(...)` during setup.

## Builder shapes

### `validRecipeBody` (firestore-rules.test.ts)

Recipe documents at `/users/{userId}/recipes/{recipeId}` require:

```ts
{
  core: {
    title: string,
    tagResult: {
      tags: [],
      allergenStatus: { [allergen]: "free" | "contains" | "unknown" },
      dietaryStatus:  { [diet]:     "free" | "contains" | "unknown" },
      coverage: 0..1,
      unknownIngredients: [],
      generatedAt: Date,
      generatorVersion: string,
      isPartial: boolean,
      schemaVersion: 1,
    },
  },
}
```

Rules validator may reject unknown fields or out-of-range coverage —
test both happy and malformed shapes when the validator changes.

## Test naming convention

Each `test()` name states the behavior in plain English. Comment IDs above
each test, grouped by collection: `// R1:` for recipes, `// U1:` for users,
`// A1:` for admin/age-gate, etc.

```ts
// R1: owner can create their own recipe with a valid tagResult
test("recipes: owner can create a recipe with valid tagResult", async () => { ... });
```

Section banners between collections:

```ts
// ============================================================================
// RECIPES (8 assertions across 6 tests)
// ============================================================================
```

## Coverage requirement

For each rule branch in the diff, prove **both** the allow path **and** the
deny path. A green `assertSucceeds` without a matching `assertFails` is not
coverage.

Standard deny matrix for ownership-checked collections:
- non-owner authenticated user
- unauthenticated user
- (when applicable) admin without the right claim

## Discovered patterns

*Append new dated entries below as the agent learns them.*

### 2026-04-25 — initial seed
Knowledge file created from `firestore-rules.test.ts` patterns observed at
agent setup time. Builders, actor conventions, and coverage rules above are
the baseline; future entries should record genuinely new shapes (new
collections, new validators, new actor types).
